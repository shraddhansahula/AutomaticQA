 Describe the circumstances leading to the outbreak of revolutionary protest in France.

A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges  In the past, peasants and workers had participated in revolts against increasing taxes and food scarcity.But they lacked the means and programmes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about a change in the social and economic order.This was left to those groups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had access to education and new ideas.The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups, termed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an expanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as woollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the richer members of society.While the men were away fighting at the front, women were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and looking after their families.Large sections of the population were convinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the Constitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections of society.Political clubs became an important rallying point for people who wished to discuss government policies and plan their own forms of action.The most successful of these clubs was that of the Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent of St Jacob in Paris.In addition to merchants and manufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers or administrative officials.The days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the countryside.Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.Much later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution of the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate this outcome.How and why did this happen?French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century  In 1774, Louis XVI of the Bourbon family of kings ascended the throne of France.

 What were the social, economic and political conditions in Russia before 1905?

When four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which had been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works, there was a call for industrial action.Over the next few days over 110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages and improvement in working conditions.When the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the Winter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks.Over 100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded.Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by birth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour and enterprise.If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor could labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint, they believed that societies would develop.Many working men and women who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and radical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.Some nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an end to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815.Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution  The Age of Social Change  In the previous chapter you read about the powerful ideas of freedom and equality that circulated in Europe after the French Revolution.The French Revolution opened up the possibility of creating a dramatic change in the way in which society was structured.As you have read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided into estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which controlled economic and social power.Suddenly, after the revolution, it seemed possible to change this.In France, Italy, Germany and Russia, they became revolutionaries and worked to overthrow existing monarchs.In January 1918, the Assembly rejected Bolshevik measures and Lenin dismissed the Assembly.He thought the All Russian Congress of Soviets was more democratic than an assembly  elected in uncertain conditions.In March 1918, despite opposition by their political allies, the Bolsheviks made peace with Germany at Brest Litovsk.In the years that followed, the Bolsheviks became the only party to participate in the elections to the All Russian Congress of Soviets, which became the Parliament of the country.

 Why did the Tsarist autocracy collapse in 1917? 

Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution  The Age of Social Change  In the previous chapter you read about the powerful ideas of freedom and equality that circulated in Europe after the French Revolution.The French Revolution opened up the possibility of creating a dramatic change in the way in which society was structured.As you have read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided into estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which controlled economic and social power.Suddenly, after the revolution, it seemed possible to change this.Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by birth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour and enterprise.If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor could labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint, they believed that societies would develop.Many working men and women who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and radical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.Some nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an end to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815.Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives had been generally opposed to the idea of change.By the nineteenth century, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed that the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about through a slow process.Such differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social and political turmoil that followed the French Revolution.The various attempts at revolution and national transformation in the nineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of these political tendencies.After the French Revolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to the need for change.When four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which had been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works, there was a call for industrial action.Over the next few days over 110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages and improvement in working conditions.When the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the Winter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks.Over 100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded.

 In what ways did the Nazi state seek to establish total control over its people?

The Red banners with the Swastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after the speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.Nazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as someone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress.It is an image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of dignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time of acute economic and political crises.The Destruction of Democracy  On 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the Chancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to Hitler.This indomitable spirit to bear witness and to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto and camp inhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives.On the other hand when the war seemed lost, the Nazi leadership distributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating evidence available in offices.Yet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs, fiction, documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many parts of the world today.These are a tribute to those who resisted it, an embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning to those who watched in silence.Nazis held massive rallies and public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil a sense of unity among the people.Presumably he meant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had happened in Nazi Germany.

 Discuss how the changes in forest management in the colonial period affected the following groups of people Plantation owners.

Forest Society and Colonialism  Take a quick look around your school and home and identify all the things that come from forests: the paper in the book you are reading, desks and tables, doors and windows, the dyes that colour your clothes, spices in your food, the cellophane wrapper of your toffee, tendu leaf in bidis, gum, honey, coffee, tea and rubber.Do not miss out the oil in chocolates, which comes from sal seeds, the tannin used to convert skins and hides into leather, or the herbs and roots used for medicinal purposes.Forests also provide bamboo, wood for fuel, grass, charcoal, packaging, fruits, flowers, animals, birds and many other things.In the Amazon forests or in the Western Ghats, it is possible to find as many as 500 different plant species in one forest patch.For example, with the growing demand for rubber in the mid-nineteenth century, the Mundurucu peoples of the Brazilian Amazon who lived in villages on high ground and cultivated manioc, began to collect latex from wild rubber trees for supplying to traders.Gradually, they descended to live in trading posts and became completely dependent on traders.In India, the trade in forest products was not new.From the medieval period onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory, bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic communities like the Banjaras.Rebellion in the Forest  In many parts of India, and across the world, forest communities rebelled against the changes that were being imposed on them.The leaders of these movements against the British like Siddhu and Kanu in the Santhal Parganas, Birsa Munda of Chhotanagpur or Alluri Sitarama Raju of Andhra Pradesh are still remembered today in songs and stories.We will now discuss in detail one such rebellion which took place in the kingdom of Bastar in 1910.The People of Bastar  Bastar is located in the southernmost part of Chhattisgarh and borders Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra.New Trades, New Employments and New Services  While people lost out in many ways after the forest department took control of the forests, some people benefited from the new opportunities that had opened up in trade.Many communities left their traditional occupations and started trading in forest products.This happened not only in India but across the world.

 Give reasons to explain why the Maasai community lost their grazing lands.

But from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving in search of pastures.They were cut off from the best grazing lands and forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.Since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were available, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease in these years of drought.An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasai in Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.At times they lost their cattle and sheep and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions their numbers have expanded over recent decades.When pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the changes in the modern world.Many ecologists believe that in dry regions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the most viable form of life.As pasture lands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that remain deteriorate through continuous over grazing.Times of drought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.Modern  Yet, pastoralists do adapt to new times.They change the paths of their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources.Pastoralists are not relics of the past.They are not people who have no place in the modern world.Environmentalists and economists have increasingly come to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is perfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.This nomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.

 What were the advantages and disadvantages of the use of mechanical harvesting machines in the USA?

How did the spread of cultivation shape the lives of the Indian groups who had once lived there?The Westward Move and Wheat Cultivation  The story of agrarian expansion is closely connected to the westward movement of the white settlers who took over the land.After the American War of Independence from 1775 to 1783 and the formation of the United States of America, the white Americans began to move westward.By the time Thomas Jefferson became President of the USA in 1800, over 700,000 white settlers had moved on to the Appalachian plateau through the passes.When offered a loan, the cultivators were tempted to accept, hoping to meet their immediate needs and pay back the loan at a later stage.But the loan tied the peasant to the headman and through him to the government.It was the government opium agents who were advancing the money to the headmen, who in turn gave it to the cultivators.By taking the loan, the cultivator was forced to grow opium on a specified area of land and hand over the produce to the agents once the crop had been harvested.He had no option of planting the field with a crop of his choice or of selling his produce to anyone but the government agent.For a very large part of the year the poor had no work.The Introduction of Threshing Machines  During the Napoleonic Wars, prices of foodgrains were high and farmers expanded production vigorously.Fearing a shortage of labour, they began buying the new threshing machines that had come into the market.They complained of the insolence of labourers, their drinking habits, and the difficulty of making them work.The machines, they thought, would help them reduce their dependence on labourers.Seen from the east coast, America seemed to be a land of promise.

 Explain why cricket became popular in India and the West Indies.

By the beginning of the nineteenth century, men like Thomas Arnold, headmaster of the famous Rugby School and founder of the modern public school system, saw team sport like cricket and rugby not just as outdoor play, but as an organised way of teaching English boys the discipline, the importance of hierarchy, the skills, the codes of honour and the leadership qualities that helped them build and run the British empire.Victorian empire builders justified the conquest of other countries as an act of unselfish social service, by which backward peoples were introduced to the civilising influence of British law and Western knowledge.Cricket helped to confirm this self-image of the English elite by glorifying the amateur ideal, where cricket was played not for victory or profit, but for its own sake, in the spirit of fair play.In actual fact the Napoleonic wars were won because of the economic contribution of the iron works of Scotland and Wales, the mills of Lancashire and the financial houses of the City of London.The English boarding school was the institution that trained English boys for careers in the military, the civil service and the church, the three great institutions of imperial England.There was a simple reason for this: the ball was bowled underarm, along the ground and the curve at the end of the bat gave the batsman the best chance of making contact.How that early version of cricket played in village England grew into the modern game played in giant stadiums in great cities is a proper subject for history because one of the uses of history is to understand how the present was made.And sport is a large part of contemporary life: it is one way in which we amuse ourselves, compete with each other, stay fit, and express our social loyalties.If tens of millions of Indians today drop everything to watch the Indian team play a Test match or a one-day international, it is reasonable for a history of India to explore how that stick-and-ball game invented in south-eastern England became the ruling passion of the Indian sub-continent.

 Give any two examples of the ways in which European dress codes were different from Indian dress codes.

Before the age of democratic revolutions and the development of capitalist markets in eighteenth-century Europe, most people dressed according to their regional codes, and were limited by the types of clothes and the cost of materials that were available in their region.Clothing styles were also strictly regulated by class, gender or status in the social hierarchy.After the eighteenth century, the colonisation of most of the world by Europe, the spread of democratic ideals and the growth of an industrial society, completely changed the ways in which people thought about dress and its meanings.People could use styles and materials that were drawn from other cultures and locations, and western dress styles for men were adopted worldwide.We saw how clothing was defined by dominant cultural attitudes and ideals of beauty, and how these notions changed over time.We saw how reformers and conservatives struggled to shape these ideals, and how changes within technology and economy, and the pressures of new times made people feel the need for change.Transformations in Colonial India  During the colonial period there were significant changes in male and female clothing in India.On the one hand this was a consequence of the influence of Western dress forms and missionary activity; on the other it was due to the effort by Indians to fashion clothing styles that embodied an indigenous tradition and culture.Sumptuary Laws and Social Hierarchy  In medieval Europe, dress codes were sometimes imposed upon members of different layers of society through actual laws which were spelt out in some detail.Modifications in clothing come to reflect these changes.

 Explain what is meant by the 1848 revolution of the liberals.

To the west, the bulk of the land was farmed by tenants and small owners, while in Eastern and Central Europe the pattern of landholding was characterised by vast estates which were cultivated by serfs.In Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial production and trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence of commercial classes whose existence was based on production for the market.Industrialisation began in England in the second half of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German states it occurred only during the nineteenth century.In its wake, new social groups came into being: a working-class population, and middle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848  As conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism and nationalism came to be increasingly associated with revolution in many regions of Europe such as the Italian and German states, the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland.These revolutions were led by the liberal-nationalists belonging to the educated middle-class elite, among whom were professors, school- teachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830.The Bourbon kings who had been restored to power during the conservative reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries who installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its head.The majority of the population was made up of the peasantry.Businessmen and small-scale producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform laws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another.However, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local populations to French rule were mixed.Initially, in many places such as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels, Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as harbingers of liberty.But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility, as it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not go hand in hand with political freedom.

 What was the objective of Phan Chu Trinh objective for Vietnam?

The US regularly bombed this trail trying to disrupt supplies, but efforts to destroy this important supply line by intensive bombing failed because they were rebuilt very quickly.The Nation and Its Heroes  Another way of looking at social movements is to see how they affect different groups in society.Let us see how the roles of women were specified in the anti-imperialist movement in Vietnam, and what that tells us about nationalist ideology.Women as Rebels  Women in Vietnam traditionally enjoyed greater equality than in China, particularly among the lower classes, but they had only limited freedom to determine their future and played no role in public life.They built six airstrips, neutralised tens of thousands of bombs, transported tens of thousands of kilograms of cargo, weapons and food and shot down fifteen planes.Between 1965 and 1975, of the 17,000 youth who worked on the trail, 70 to 80 per cent were women.One military historian argues that there were 1.5 million women in the regular army, the militia, the local forces and professional teams.Women in Times of Peace  By the 1970s, as peace talks began to get under way and the end of the war seemed near, women were no longer represented as warriors.They tried to change the values, norms and perceptions of the people, to make them believe in the superiority of French civilisation and the inferiority of the Vietnamese.Vietnamese intellectuals, on the other hand, feared that Vietnam was losing not just control over its territory but its very identity: its own culture and customs were being devalued and the people were developing a master-slave mentality.The battle against French colonial education became part of the larger battle against colonialism and for independence.Hygiene, Disease and Everyday Resistance  Education was not the only sphere of everyday life in which such political battles against colonialism were fought.As the nationalist movement grew, the status of women came to be questioned and a new image of womanhood emerged.

 Why did political leaders differ sharply over the question of separate electorates?

When they acted in the name of Mahatma Gandhi, or linked their movement to that of the Congress, they were identifying with a movement which went beyond the limits of their immediate locality.Towards Civil Disobedience  In February 1922, Mahatma Gandhi decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement.He felt the movement was turning violent in many places and satyagrahis needed to be properly trained before they would be ready for mass struggles.Within the Congress, some leaders were by now tired of mass struggles and wanted to participate in elections to the provincial councils that had been set up by the Government of India Act of 1919.They were apprehensive of the spread of militant activities, and worried about prolonged disruption of business, as well as of the growing influence of socialism amongst the younger members of the Congress.The industrial working classes did not participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement in large numbers, except in the Nagpur region.As the industrialists came closer to the Congress, workers stayed aloof.But in spite of that, some workers did participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement, selectively adopting some of the ideas of the Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign goods, as part of their own movements against low wages and poor working conditions.For plantation workers in Assam, freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they were enclosed, and it meant retaining a link with the village from which they had come.Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave the tea gardens without permission, and in fact they were rarely given such permission.When they heard of the Non-Cooperation Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the plantations and headed home.They believed that Gandhi Raj was coming and everyone would be given land in their own villages.Swaraj in the Plantations  Workers too had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi and the notion of swaraj.

 Explain the causes of the Great Depression.

It was not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest.It was transported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships which were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid workers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.Some of this dramatic change, though on a smaller scale, occurred closer home in west Punjab.Here the British Indian government built a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes into fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for export.Thus by 1890, a global agricultural economy had taken shape, accompanied by complex changes in labour movement patterns, capital flows, ecologies and technology.Food no longer came from a nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away.Similar stories can be told about the impact of Western conquest on other parts of the nineteenth-century world.Indentured Labour Migration from India  The example of indentured labour migration from India also illustrates the two-sided nature of the nineteenth-century world.It was a world of faster economic growth as well as great misery, higher incomes for some and poverty for others, technological advances in some areas and new forms of coercion in others.In the nineteenth century, hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese labourers went to work on plantations, in mines, and in road and railway construction projects around the world.All over the world some 150 million are estimated to have left their homes, crossed oceans and vast distances over land in search of a better future.

 Why did some industrialists in nineteenth-century Europe prefer hand labour over machines?

As you have seen in the textbook last year, this was a time when open fields were disappearing and commons were being enclosed.Cottagers and poor peasants who had earlier depended on common lands for their survival, gathering their firewood, berries, vegetables, hay and straw, had to now look for alternative sources of income.Many had tiny plots of land which could not provide work for all members of the household.So when merchants came around and offered advances to produce goods for them, peasant households eagerly agreed.From the late eighteenth century, as you have read in your book last year, the British in India began exporting opium to China and took tea from China to England.Many Indians became junior players in this trade, providing finance, procuring supplies, and shipping consignments.Having earned through trade, some of these businessmen had visions of developing industrial enterprises in India.In Bengal, Dwarkanath Tagore made his fortune in the China trade before he turned to industrial investment, setting up six joint-stock companies in the 1830s and 1840s.From the United Provinces, for instance, they went to work in the textile mills of Bombay and in the jute mills of Calcutta.In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around.Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the industrial centres in search of work.Over 50 per cent workers in the Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their textile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur.Till this time, as you have seen, cloth production was spread all over the countryside and carried out within village households.But now, the costly new machines could be purchased, set up and maintained in the mill.Within the mill all the processes were brought together under one roof and management.This allowed a more careful supervision over the production process, a watch over quality, and the regulation of labour, all of which had been difficult to do when production was in the countryside.At the end of the eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton piece-goods into India.But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s this figure was over 50 per cent.Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time: their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being glutted with Manchester imports.Produced by machines at lower costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could not easily compete with them.

 Explain the social changes in London which led to the need for the Underground railway.

Women of the upper and middle classes in Britain, on the other hand, faced increasingly higher levels of isolation, although their lives were made easier by domestic maids who cooked, cleaned and cared for young children on low wages.Women who worked for wages had some control over their lives, particularly among the lower social classes.However, many social reformers felt that the family as an institution had broken down, and needed to be saved or reconstructed by pushing these women back into the home.Men, Women and Family in the City  The city no doubt encouraged a new spirit of individualism among both men and women, and a freedom from the collective values that were a feature of the smaller rural communities.Libraries, art galleries and museums were established in the nineteenth century to provide people with a sense of history and pride in the achievements of the British.At first, visitors to the British Museum in London numbered just about 15,000 every year, but when entry was made free in 1810, visitors swamped the museum: their number jumped to 127,643 in 1824-25, shooting up to 825, 901 by 1846.Music halls were popular among the lower classes, and, by the early twentieth century, cinema became the great mass entertainment for mixed audiences.British industrial workers were increasingly encouraged to spend their holidays by the sea, so as to derive the benefits of the sun and bracing winds.Meanwhile, working classes met in pubs to have a drink, exchange news and sometimes also to organise for political action.Many new types of large-scale entertainment for the common people came into being, some made possible with money from the state.Over 1 million British people went to the seaside at Blackpool in 1883; by 1939 their numbers had gone up to 7 million.

 Explain how print culture assisted the growth of nationalism in India.

To counter this, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and Urdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious newspapers and tracts.The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867, published thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim readers how to conduct themselves in their everyday lives, and explaining the meanings of Islamic doctrines.All through the nineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries appeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen on enlarging its following and countering the influence of its opponents.Urdu print helped them conduct these battles in public.But Kashibaba, a Kanpur millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to show the links between caste and class exploitation.The poems of another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan.By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example of Bombay workers.These were sponsored by social reformers who tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and, sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism.Among Hindus, too, print encouraged the reading of religious texts, especially in the vernacular languages.Print and Censorship  Before 1798, the colonial state under the East India Company was not too concerned with censorship.Strangely, its early measures to control printed matter were directed against Englishmen in India who were critical of Company misrule and hated the actions of particular Company officers.The Company was worried that such criticisms might be used by its critics in England to attack its trade monopoly in India.They feared that colonial rulers would encourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws.

 What were the effects of the spread of print culture for poor people in nineteenth century India?

They feared that colonial rulers would encourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws.To counter this, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and Urdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious newspapers and tracts.The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867, published thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim readers how to conduct themselves in their everyday lives, and explaining the meanings of Islamic doctrines.All through the nineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries appeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen on enlarging its following and countering the influence of its opponents.Urdu print helped them conduct these battles in public.But Kashibaba, a Kanpur millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to show the links between caste and class exploitation.The poems of another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan.By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example of Bombay workers.These were sponsored by social reformers who tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and, sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism.Strangely, its early measures to control printed matter were directed against Englishmen in India who were critical of Company misrule and hated the actions of particular Company officers.The Company was worried that such criticisms might be used by its critics in England to attack its trade monopoly in India.By the 1820s, the Calcutta Supreme Court passed certain regulations to control press freedom and the Company began encouraging publication of newspapers that would celebrate Britsh rule.In 1835, faced with urgent petitions by editors of English and vernacular newspapers, Governor-General Bentinck agreed to revise press laws.They attacked the sacred authority of the Church and the despotic power of the state, thus eroding the legitimacy of a social order based on tradition.The writings of Voltaire and Rousseau were read widely; and those who read these books saw the world through new eyes, eyes that were questioning, critical and rational.Second: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate.All values, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a public that had become aware of the power of reason, and recognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs.

 Describe the ways in which the novel in India attempted to create a sense of pan-Indian belonging.
Suri Nambuthiri, the foolish landlord who comes to marry Indulekha, is the focus of much satire in the novel.The intelligent heroine rejects him and chooses Madhavan, the educated and handsome Nayar as her husband, and the young couple move to Madras, where Madhavan joins the civil service.Suri Nambuthiri, desperate to find a partner for himself, finally marries a poorer relation from the same family and goes away pretending that he has married Indulekha!Chandu Menon clearly wanted his readers to appreciate the new values of his hero and heroine and criticise the ignorance and immorality of Suri Nambuthiri.Novels like Indirabai and Indulekha were written by members of the upper castes, and were primarily about upper-caste characters.The story of Indulekha is interesting in the light of these debates.Detective and mystery novels often had to be printed again and again to meet the demand of readers: some of them were reprinted as many as twenty-two times!The novel also assisted in the spread of silent reading.We are so used to reading in silence that it is difficult for us to think that this practice was not very common in the past.As late as the nineteenth century and perhaps even in the early twentieth century, written texts were often read aloud for several people to hear.Sometimes novels were also read in this way, but in general novels encouraged reading alone and in silence.But not all novels were of this kind.
